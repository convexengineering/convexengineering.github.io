We're pleased to announce the release of GPkit version 0.5.0, featuring a new gpkit.Vectorize environment, an experimental debug() method for Model objects, and several additional improvements. More info is available [on gihub](https://github.com/hoburg/gpkit/releases/tag/v0.5.0).

We’ve also expanded the documentation, including new sections on [debugging models](http://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/debugging.html) and on [building complex models](http://gpkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modelbuilding.html).

We always look forward to hearing stories of how GPkit is being used, so please let us know what goes wrong and what goes right!
