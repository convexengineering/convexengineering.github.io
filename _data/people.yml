    bio: Philippe is a graduate of the Convex Engineering Group, having received his
      Master's degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2016. Although he loves
      finding global optima, the focus of Philippe's  research was the use of
      signomial programming for aircraft design optimization.  During his time at
      MIT, he was a recipient of the NASA Aeronautics Fellowship. Philippe
      currently works as an Optimization Engineer for Hyperloop One, where he is
      actively and enthusiastically using GPkit, whilst trying (and failing) not to
      sound too preachy about how awesome geometric programming is.  Outside of using
      powerful optimization techniques, Philippe enjoys rowing, cycling,
      snowboarding, and petting strangers' dogs.

    bio: Berk Ozturk is interested in the application of geometric and signomial programming
      for conceptual design. He seeks to leverage robust SPs in design under
      uncertainty, and develops GP relaxations to solve mixed integer non-linear problems such as 
      water network design and control. In his free time, 
      he is an avid athlete, and VP of the MIT Cycling Team. 
      He enjoys reading non-fiction, traveling and cooking. 
      He received his B.S. and S.M. in Aerospace Engineering from MIT.

      and is currently working on Robust Geometric Programming formulations.
      He received a BE in Mechanical Engineering and a BS in Mathematics from the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 2016.
      As an undergraduate, he was a member of the Microfluidics lab and worked on designing a surface tension actuated micropump,
      and used stochastic sampling to design fast algorithms for inverse particle tracking in stochastic flow fields.
      He was a visiting student in the Aerospace Computational Design Laboratory,
      and worked with the Uncertainty Quantification Group on implementing a model of the sap exudation in maple trees using MUQ,
      and inferring the uncertain inputs to that model using MCMC methods.

    bio: Arthur Brown's research interests are primarily in clean-sheet design of innovative aircraft concepts,
      and he is currently working on projects relating to the design and optimization of electric aircraft.
      In the Computational Aerodynamics Lab at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies,
      Arthur used high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes aerodynamic shape optimization
      to redesign a series of airliner wings to burn less fuel by flying lower and more slowly.
      He also worked for a year as an aerodynamicist with Blue Sky Solar Racing, the University of Toronto solar car racing team,
      and for a summer in the same capacity with U of T's Human-Powered Vehicle Design Team.
      In 2015, he became the first ever Canadian student to win the AIAA Aircraft Design Competition,
      with an entry in the Undergraduate Individual category; he placed second in the same contest in 2016.
      In his spare time, Arthur is an avid fisherman; he also enjoys long-distance running, basketball, military history, and chess.
