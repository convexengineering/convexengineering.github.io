    bio: Philippe is a graduate of the Convex Engineering Group, having received his
      Master's degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2016. Although he loves
      finding global optima, the focus of Philippe's  research was the use of
      signomial programming for aircraft design optimization.  During his time at
      MIT, he was a recipient of the NASA Aeronautics Fellowship. Philippe
      currently works as an Optimization Engineer for Hyperloop One, where he is
      actively and enthusiastically using GPkit, whilst trying (and failing) not to
      sound too preachy about how awesome geometric programming is.  Outside of using
      powerful optimization techniques, Philippe enjoys rowing, cycling,
      snowboarding, and petting strangers' dogs.

    bio: Arthur Brown's research interests are primarily in clean-sheet design of innovative aircraft concepts,
      and he is currently working on projects relating to the design and optimization of electric aircraft.
      In the Computational Aerodynamics Lab at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies,
      Arthur used high-fidelity Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes aerodynamic shape optimization
      to redesign a series of airliner wings to burn less fuel by flying lower and more slowly.
      He also worked for a year as an aerodynamicist with Blue Sky Solar Racing, the University of Toronto solar car racing team,
      and for a summer in the same capacity with U of T's Human-Powered Vehicle Design Team.
      In 2015, he became the first ever Canadian student to win the AIAA Aircraft Design Competition,
      with an entry in the Undergraduate Individual category; he placed second in the same contest in 2016.
