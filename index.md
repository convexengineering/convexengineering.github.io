# Convex Engineering Group

**We use convex optimization to rethink the engineering design process.**
Convexity helps engineering teams develop a deep understanding of system tradeoffs by providing mathematical guarantees and solving for thousands of decision variables in seconds.
In our modeling framework [GPkit], convexity also serves as a shared design language. This Convex Engineering approach was integral to the conception and design of the [MIT Jungle Hawk Owl](http://news.mit.edu/2017/drones-stay-aloft-five-days-0607), an unmanned aircraft designed to stay aloft for five days.

Our tools are in active use at Aurora Flight Sciences, Airbus, Hyperloop One, Shell Oil and Google \[x\].

### Our Research is Open Source
We incorporate new insights and algorithms into these tools as patterns of their use mature. Additionally we maintain an [open-source library of reusable models][GPlibrary].  If you have any questions, or would like to get involved, [send us an email](mailto:gpkit@mit.edu)!
