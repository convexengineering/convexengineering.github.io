# Convex Engineering Group

**We use convex optimization to rethink the engineering design process.**
Convexity helps engineering teams develop a deep understanding of system tradeoffs by providing mathematical guarantees while solving for thousands of decision variables in seconds.
In our modeling framework [GPkit], convexity serves as a shared design language. GPkit and the design process we've built around it are integral to the conception and design of the [MIT Jungle Hawk Owl](http://news.mit.edu/2017/drones-stay-aloft-five-days-0607), an unmanned aircraft designed to stay aloft for five days.

These methods are also in active use at Aurora Flight Sciences, Hyperloop One, Kitty Hawk, RAND, Shell Oil and Google \[x\].

### Our Research is Open Source
We incorporate new insights and algorithms into these tools as patterns of their use mature, and maintain an [open-source library of reusable models][GPlibrary]. If you have questions or would like to get involved, [send us an email](mailto:gpkit@mit.edu)!
